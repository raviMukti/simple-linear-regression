# Simple Linear Regression

Linear Regression build with Python3

## Regression

Regression is used to see the form of the relationship between variables through an equation. There are three types of regression used according to the purpose of the analysis, namely Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Non-Linear Regression. The relationship can be a causal relationship but it can also measure how much a variable affects other variables and can be used to forecast the value of a variable based on other variables.

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a method used to see the relationship between one independent variable (free) and has a straight line relationship with the dependent variable (bound). An observation variable obtained is very likely to be influenced by other variables, for example a person's height and weight.

### Case Study

Based on this github project [febi1717](https://github.com/febi1717/RegresiLinear), the case study is to predict the amount of corn harvested using fertilizer variable and find out how much influence fertilizer has  on the amount of corn harvest

## Project Structure
